# flutter_aad

This project is a prototype for the assignment 1 of Advanced App Development taught at Saxion.

## Requirements

For running this application, you will need to have installed Flutter and add it in your path. You will also need JDK and JRE in your enviroment variables. If there is any problem, run in terminal the command: flutter doctor When you clone the project, I suggest using VS code and opening the project there. You will need to install the Flutter and Dart extensions.
